## 📌 Project Overview  

This project is designed to gain insights into **Data Engineering job postings on LinkedIn**.  
Using the **LinkedIn Jobs API** from RapidAPI, it extracts job posting data, transforms it into a clean tabular format, and loads it into a **SQL Server** database.  
The data is then visualized in **Power BI** to uncover hiring trends and skill demand.

### Objectives  
Analyze job market demand for data engineers within the last 7 days and answer questions such as:  

- Total number of Data Engineering postings in the past week  
- Number of remote positions available  
- Number of full-time postings  
- Distribution of employment types (%)  
- Number of job postings by employer  
- Number of job postings by state  
- Top skills required for Data Engineering roles  

This project demonstrates a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline with **Power BI dashboards** for insights.  


## 🛠 Tech Stack  

- **Python** → for API requests & data extraction  
- **Pandas** → for data cleaning and transformation  
- **SQL Server** → for structured data storage  
- **Power BI** → for visualization and dashboard reporting  

---

## 🔄 ETL Workflow  

### 1. Extract  
- Retrieve Data Engineering job postings from the **LinkedIn Jobs API (RapidAPI)**.  
- Pull job title, company name, location, employment type, posting date, and skills.  

### 2. Transform  
- Convert API response into a tabular format using **Pandas**.  
- Clean and standardize fields (dates, employer names, job locations, employment types).  
- Derive new features such as remote vs. on-site, employment type categories, and skill frequency counts.  

### 3. Load  
- Insert transformed data into **SQL Server** database tables.  
- Store both raw and cleaned datasets for reproducibility.  

### 4. Visualize  
- Connect **Power BI** to the SQL Server database.  
- Build interactive dashboards to show:  
  - Total postings (7 days)  
  - Remote vs. onsite jobs  
  - Full-time vs. part-time vs. contract distributions  
  - Top employers hiring data engineers  
  - Job postings by state  
  - Top technical skills required  

⚡ This enables recruiters, hiring managers, and aspiring data engineers to identify where demand is highest, which companies are hiring, and what skills are most valuable.

## 🚀 How to Run 

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-engineering-job-postings.git
cd data-engineering-job-postings
________________________________________
2. Set Up Python Environment
Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed. Then install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
________________________________________
3. Configure Environment Variables
This project requires a RapidAPI key and SQL Server connection details.
1.	Create a .env file in the root directory:
2.	RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_api_key_here
3.	SQL_SERVER=your_server_name
4.	SQL_DATABASE=your_database_name
5.	SQL_USERNAME=your_username
6.	SQL_PASSWORD=your_password
7.	These values are loaded inside the Python script to keep credentials secure.
⚠️ Never commit .env files to GitHub.
________________________________________
4. Run the ETL Script
Execute the Python script to extract, transform, and load the data into SQL Server:
Python Script.ipnyb
•	The script will fetch Data Engineering postings from LinkedIn’s API (last 7 days).
•	It will clean and transform the dataset using Pandas.
•	Finally, it will insert the cleaned data into your SQL Server database.
________________________________________
5. Verify Data in SQL Server
•	Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
•	Run queries against your database to confirm that the tables have been populated, for example:
SELECT TOP 10 * FROM LinkedInJobs;
________________________________________
6. Open the Power BI Dashboard
1.	Open powerbi/linkedin_jobs_dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop.
2.	Update the database connection to match your SQL Server credentials.
3.	Refresh the data to see the latest job postings.
________________________________________
7. Explore the Insights
The Power BI dashboard includes:
•	Total postings in the last 7 days
•	Remote vs. onsite jobs
•	Full-time vs. contract distribution
•	Job postings by employer
•	Job postings by U.S. state
•	Top technical skills required
